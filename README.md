This repository enables the prediction of the ultimate bending capacity under local buckling, of cold-formed steel (CFS) beams with staggered slotted web perforations using advanced ensemble machine learning models (see publishaed paper for more detaisl: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcsr.2025.110024). The models implemented include random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost). These models were developed from a dataset of 432 validated finite element (FE) simulations reported by Degtyareva et al. (2020), which examined the influence of staggered perforations on local buckling strength and proposed design rules for designing CFS section with staggered slotted web perforations. Hyperparameters for each algorithm were fine-tuned through Bayesian optimization to maximize predictive performance.
